# B-tree Index in PostgreSQL

## Overview

**B-tree** indexes in PostgreSQL are the default index type and are widely used due to their versatility and efficiency in handling a variety of queries.

## Broad Applicability
- B-tree indexes support the following types of queries:
  - **Equality queries**: Example: `=`.
  - **Range queries**: Examples: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.
  - **Partial match queries**: Example: `LIKE 'abc%'` (prefix matching).
- B-tree indexes are also useful for:
  - Enforcing uniqueness constraints.
  - Supporting foreign keys.
  - Efficiently handling sorting operations.

## Low Overhead
- **Low Maintenance Costs**: B-tree indexes have relatively low overhead compared to more complex index types like GIN or GiST. 
- **Efficient Structure**: They maintain a sorted structure that allows for efficient data retrieval during inserts, updates, and deletes, which helps maintain performance.
- **Balanced Performance**: B-tree offers a good balance between query performance, storage space, and maintenance, making it an optimal choice for many scenarios.

## Conclusion
B-tree indexes are ideal for handling a wide range of query types with minimal overhead, making them the default and most commonly used index type in PostgreSQL. They are particularly effective for exact matches and range-based queries, offering a balance between efficiency and low maintenance costs.
